        description: "April break is when we all escape to the desert. Day 1 saw us ride Behind the Reef, then take a short side hike in a slot canyon. Day two we climbed up and over some mesas and dropped into a new landscape each time. We found the water cache that Lindsay and Hilary had dropped (WOOHOO!), then continued past a few more bullet-riddled cars. On day 3 we climbed up and over our last mesas, then finished the ride by descending through an abandoned uranium mine."

After a snack break at the top we dropped down the backside, passed the old mining town of Animas Forks, and finally made our way into Silverton for some pizza. On day two we biked out and took a turn up and over Cinnamon Pass, then pedaled our way back into Lake City where Sam and Hannah kindly picked us up."

On day 2 we topped out above 13,000 feet on Imogene Pass and then dropped into Telluride. Day 3 saw us taking the Galloping Goose singletrack south to Priest lake. On day 4 we went up and over Ophir Pass, dropped into Silverton and headed out to camp at Maggie Gulch. Our last day saw us climb out of Maggie Gulch towards Engineer Pass, then down a rough and rowdy road that dropped us onto the Million Dollar Highway and back into Ouray.'
